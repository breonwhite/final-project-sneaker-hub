    description: "The Nike Air Jordan III Retro White/Cement from 2011 was a long overdue release. By 2011, the White Cement Jordan III had sat in the vault at Nike since the 2003 release. Which meant, for most sneakerheads, you had already burned through at least a pair or two of the iconic Jordan 3 sneaker. This variation of the White Cement Jordan III Retro was the first time it became a problem that the 'Nike Air' wasn't on the heel of the shoe. Purists might have been offish with the 2003 release but it became mainstream to complain about the Jumpman on the heel thanks to platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Outside of sneaker enthusiasts, however, it didn't matter because the memories of the 1988 Dunk Contest, and MJ taking off from the free throw line still conjured up memories for Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan fans. The 2011 Jordan III sold well initially, selling out in most places rather quickly but restocks meant getting your hands on a pair wasn't impossible, especially considering the latte January release that meant plenty of holiday money burning a hole in the pockets of sneaker enthusiasts. In terms of quality and availability, the 2011 Air Jordan Retro 3 White Cement might be the lowest of all the original colorway Jordan 3s but it will always have a mass appeal that most sneakers will never have thanks to Michael Jordan.",
